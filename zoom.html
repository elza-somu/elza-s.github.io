            <h4>The Opportunity</h4>
            <p> This is the project I did for the UX course I took at Juno College. The purpose of this project was to
              create a digital
              prototype, present research insights & findings, and presenting findings from usability testing.</p>
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p> Professionals who work from home and are trying to achieve a work-life balance, want a more interactive
              space to
              interact with friends and family so that they can feel more mentally and socially connected at the end of
              their day.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Project Type</strong> — Individual</li>
              <li><strong>Role</strong> — Research, Ideation, UI/UX</li>
              <li><strong>Tools</strong>— Figma, Miro, Google Slides</li>
              <li><strong>Timeline</strong> — May to July 2021</li>

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 content">
            <p>During the Research Phase extensive user interviews and study was done to understand the root cause of
              the why it was not easy to be conducting social events over virtual meetings.</p>
            <h5>User Interview</h5>
            <p>To gather information on how a user conducts their work and social life online it was important to
              understand their
              daily patterns and how they choose to interact with various platforms. A qualitative approach was deemed
              the best to
              gather enough information on participant interaction and their outlook on virtual meeting spaces.</p>
            <p>The interview process was conducted both online and offline with users of various meeting platforms. Each
              candidate has
              also attended various events or activities online which made them suitable candidates.</p>
            <h5>Participants profile
            </h5>
            <p>The interview was divided into 4 main questions with sub-questions to gather more information on their
              roles and general
              outlook</p>
            <ul class="interview">
              <li><strong>Number of persons interviewed</strong> - 6</li>
              <li><strong>Age group</strong> - 26 to 35</li>
              <li><strong>Work Type</strong> - Work from Home</li>

              <li>Users of the platform need a way to be able to interact more organically.</li>
              <li>Use of camera and audio usually tends to take up a lot more bandwidth which tend to make the calls
                choppy
                and drop offs
                become higher.

            <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
            <p>From here, we looked at the main competitors for Zoom to understand their workings and what they use to
              retain their
              users.

            <h5>Creating a WireFrame</h5>
            <p>Using my finding in interviews and I created a wireframe prototype on Figma of some additional features
              that would help
              address the key points of improvement.</p>
            <img src="./assets/images/zoom/wireframe.png" alt=" Wireframe" class="img">
            <h5>Usability testing: Wireframe Prototype</h5>
            <p>I had an in-class useability test who took the first stab and was able to get a fair idea of what works
              and what I can
              do further.</p>
            <p>I assigned them two tasks:</p>
            <ol class="alpha">
              <li>Create a meeting, start a meeting room</li>
              <li>Chat privately with a group of people</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>Feedback</h5>
            <p><strong>Pros: </strong>Saw create an avatar quickly, is interested in checking it out. Though that it is
              useful to be able to talk to
              more than 1 person privately.</p>
            <p><strong>Areas of Improvement: </strong>Can the user start meeting and then change type after? Option to
              select avatar in virtual playground screen, as well as
              additional options.</p>
            <p><strong>Others: </strong>Ability to select avatar in virtual playground screen, as well as additional
              options.</p>

            <h5>Key Take-Aways</h5>
            <p>I decided to retain the orange buttons for only new features, as the colour change drew users attention
              immediately.</p>

              <h5>Visual Design</h5>
              <!-- <img src="./assets/images/moodboard.jpeg" alt="visual mood board" class="vd"> -->
              <p>Using the feedbacks during usability testing and findings from the user interviews I decided to try
                having 3 new features on the zoom main page </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Virtual playground</li>
                <li>Choose an Avatar</li>
                <li>Choose a filter</li>
              </ul>


              <img src="./assets/images/zoom/hifi1.png" alt="Hi-fi wireframe" class="vd">
              <p>But while doing my second round of usability testing, I quickly realised that users were drawn to the
                playground feature,
                and they wanted to be able to access the avatar and filters while in the playground. </p>
              <h5 class="mt-5">Hi-fidelity WireFrames</h5>
              <p>And thus I was able to reach my final prototype which includes the avatar and filters as features while
                in meeting or playground.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 next">
              <p>I created a digital wireframe first to be able to understand how users would interact with the options
                available and
                what they are drawn to. This helped me to be able to narrow down to the aspects that I would like to
                focus on and the
                functionalities which seemed to interest users.
                Throughout this experience, I’ve learned that not everyone thinks the same. I also understood that
                something that might
                seem obvious to me might not appear the same to everyone. Some of my key findings were:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Interactions help people feel less fatigued by being in online meetings. I was able to draw from the
                  experiences of
                  gamers who use interactions in the game environment to help them feel like they are part of something.
                </li>
                <li>Micro and organic interactions are very essential to users as this mimics a day to day social
                  environment, rather than
                  be forced to chat with an entire group vs a single user.</li>
                <li>Being on camera or being conscious of being seen all the time is quite draining on users and
                  alternatives like avatars
                  and filters will help to alleviate this.</li>
              </ol>
