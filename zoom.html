              <h5 class="problem">The Problem</h5>
              <p>How might we create a virtual space in Zoom, for professionals who work from home to connect.
                The idea was to create a more
                interactive space to connect with colleges and friends so that they can feel more mentally and socially
                recharged at the
                end of their day. </p>
              <h5>The Solution</h5>
              <p>The solution provided users a means to be able to interact in a metaverse, allowing them to move about
                and have a means to interact with the app, while also being part of social or business gatherings.</p>

          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 content">
            <p>To understand the users, extensive user interviews and the market study was conducted to grasp the root
              cause of why
              it was not easy to have a natural interaction over virtual meetings. </p>
            <p>To comprehend this the steps that were undertaken were: </p>
            <ul class="steps">

          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 content">
            <p>During the Market Research, a comprehensive study was done to understand how 'direct competitive apps'
              function, also
              where these apps succeed and where it fails in engaging their users. </p>
            <h6 class="mt-2">Direct Competitive Apps</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Google Meet</li>

            <figcaption class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-5">Direct & Indirect competitor app to Zoom</figcaption>



            <h6 class="mt-2">Competitive Analysis</h6>
            <p>It was while doing this analysis, that it was derived, that most of the direct competition for Zoom
              operated
              on the same
              thought process, and just provided a means to converse online.
            </p>
            <p>The focus was then shifted to Indirect competition, and landing on gaming. While studying popular games
              which rely on
              human interaction, it was deduced that the fatigue and frustration that one feels while on a virtual call
              is eliminated while in a game environment. It was possible to have organic interaction and work together
              in
              these zones
              while creating, building and developing in this space.</p>

            <h6 class="mt-2">Indirect Competitive Apps</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Fortnite</li>

          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 content">

            <p> Once a basic understanding was formed on how the other products on the market performed, it was time
              to
              gather
              information from actual users of the platform to understand their pain points and see what they desire
              in
              a virtual
              meeting app. </p>
            <p>A qualitative approach was deemed best to gather enough information on participant interaction and
              their
              outlook on
              virtual meeting spaces.
            </p>
            <p>The interview process was conducted, both online and offline with users of various meeting platforms.
              Each candidate
              also had to have attended a virtual event in the past 90 days to make them suitable candidates for the
              interview.</p>
            <h6>Participants profile
            </h6>
            <p>The interview was divided into 4 main questions with sub-questions to gather more information on their
              roles and general
              outlook</p>
            <ul class="interview">
              <li><strong>Number of persons interviewed</strong> - 6</li>

              <li><strong>Work Type</strong> - Work from Home</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>User Interviews Findings</h6>
            <p>The user interview provided key insight on how a person interacts online and their emotional and mental
              reaction to being in a virtual meeting.</p>

            <p> To process the information from the User Interview, an Affinity Map was created. The main buckets for

              <h6>Creating a WireFrame</h6>
              <p>Using the finding in interviews, empathy map, affinity map, a wireframe prototype was created on
                Figma
                to address the findings from the synthesis</p>
              <img src="./assets/images/zoom/wireframe.png" alt=" Wireframe" class="img img-fluid">
              <h5>Usability testing: Wireframe Prototype</h5>
              <p>With the above wireframe, initial useability testing was conducted to gauge a user's natural
                progression on the app.</p>
              <p>The users were assigned two main tasks:</p>
              <ol class="alpha">
                <li>Create and start a new meeting room</li>
                <li>Chat privately with a group of people</li>
              </ol>
              <h5>Feedback</h5>
              <p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>The 'Create an avatar' and 'Playground' quickly drew attention.</li>
                <li>The ability to be able to chat privately in a smaller group of 2 or 3 was deemed extremely
                  useful..
                </li>


                <p><strong>Areas of Improvement: </strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ability to enter 'Playground' while already in the meeting </li>
                  <li>Ability to select avatar in virtual playground screen, as well as additional
                    options.</li>
                </ul>
                <!-- Can the user start meeting and then change type after? Option
                to
                select avatar in virtual playground screen, as well as
                additional options.</p> -->
                <!-- <p><strong>Others: </strong>Ability to select avatar in virtual playground screen, as well as additional
                  options. -->

                <h5>Key Take-Aways</h5>
                <p>It was decided to retain a 'Hero button'(button with a different colour) for only new features, as
                  the
                  colour change in the layout drew users
                  attention
                  immediately.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="row container-fluid">
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-12 ">
                <h4 id="solution">Visual Design</h4>
              </div>

              <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 content">

                <p>Using the feedbacks during usability testing and findings from the user interviews, it was decided
                  to have 2 new features on the zoom main page </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>A virtual environment that allows for interactions and reward-based activities.</li>
                  <li>Chat allows for organic conversations while in a larger meeting environment.</li>

                </ul>


                <img src="./assets/images/zoom/hifi1.png" alt="Hi-fi wireframe" class="vd img-fluid">
                <p>But while doing the second round of usability testing, it quickly became obvious that users were
                  drawn
                  to
                  the
                  playground feature,
                  and they wanted to be able to access the avatar and filters while in the playground. </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

            <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-12 content">
              <p>And thus the final prototype was created, which includes the avatar and filters as features. It
                is
                possible to access them while
                in meeting or playground mode.</p>

                options
                available and
                what they are drawn to. This helped to narrow down to the aspects that I would like to
                focus on and the
                functionalities which seemed to interest users.
                Throughout this experience, I’ve learned that not everyone thinks the same. I also understood that
                something that might
                seem obvious to me might not appear the same to everyone. Some of my key findings were:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Interactions help people feel less fatigued by being in online meetings. I was able to draw from
                  the
                  experiences of
                  gamers who use interactions in the game environment to help them feel like they are part of
                  something.
                </li>
                <li>Micro and organic interactions are very essential to users as this mimics a day to day social
                  environment, rather than
                  being forced to chat with an entire group vs a single user.</li>
                <li>Being on camera or being conscious of being seen all the time is quite draining on users and
                  alternatives like avatars
                  and filters will help to alleviate this.</li>
              </ol>
