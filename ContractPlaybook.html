              <h5 class="problem">The Problem</h5>
              <p>I was brought on board to tackle the challenges associated with the existing Contract Playbook tool within procurement. These challenges included users' difficulty in finding necessary information due to feature overload, leading to frustration. Moreover, the tool suffered from inconsistent branding across the product suite, contributing to a disjointed user experience. Additionally, its poor performance and recurring bugs hampered its functionality. </p>
              <h5>The Goal</h5>
              <p>My aim was to comprehend the stakeholders' objectives for the tool and enhance the overall workflow, with the overarching goal of restoring confidence in the contracting solution for CM/CLs.</p>

              into my

            <h5 class="mt-2">Getting Up-to-Speed</h5>
            <p>Before suggesting any potential solutions, it was imperative to gain a thorough understanding of the
              current product,
              the market, the industry, and the end-users. I had to acquire comprehensive knowledge about the industry
              and the product
              in its current state.</p>
            <p>What was done</p>
            <ul>
              <li>1-on-1 Sessions with PM and SME's</li>
              <li>Product Demos of existing solutions</li>
              <li>Requirements Gathering</li>
              <li>Competitive Analysis</li>
              <li>Market Research</li>

              <li>User Personas</li>


            <!--</ul>
            <img src="assets/images/contractpluse/Persona.png" class=" img-fluid" />
            <figcaption class="d-flex justify-content-center mb-5">Persona For the users for Contract Pluse</figcaption>-->



            <h5 class="mt-3">Personas and Customer Interviews</h5>
            <p>Focusing on our procurement teams, our primary audience primarily consists of Category Managers and
              Category Leaders
              (CM/CLs). We established personas representing these professionals and consistently consulted them
              throughout the entire
              design process.
            </p>
            <h6>Interviews</h6>
            <p>I set up interviews with 10 of our end users to learn their process, which tools they use daily, what
              they like, their
              needs, and their pain points.</p>

            <h6>Key Findings</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>A significant number of our customers have developed individualized solutions to address existing
                usability challenges.</li>
              <li>Different teams had unique requirements and anticipated the tool to be flexible in accommodating these
                needs.</li>
              <li>Within the same team, managers employed the software in diverse ways.
              </li>
              <li>All customers expressed a preference for enhancements that could enhance the application's
                quality and
                were enthusiastic
                about fresh possibilities.</li>
              <li>Users needed the capability to access the legally approved clause and key considerations while also
                having
                the option to
                explore potential alternative clauses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="mt-2">Analyzing and Reviewing the Existing Product</h5>
            <p>Comprehending the current product was vital in determining which solutions to recommend. I established
              daily 1 on 1
              sessions with the Team Lead and SMEs, during which we conducted in-depth walkthroughs of the application
              to gain insight
              into its core features and functionality.</p>

            <p>In the initial phases, I identified numerous usability issues that I classified as "low-hanging
              fruit."
              These issues
              were readily identifiable and could be addressed by adhering to fundamental usability standards without
              causing any
              disruption to the existing user experience.

            <p>Before outlining the steps for a proposed solution, I will dedicate time to conducting thorough research
              and analysis of
              our competitors.
            </p>

            <p>The objective of this competitive analysis is to assess the strengths and weaknesses of our competitors'
              solutions
              within the market, with a focus on identifying areas for improvement and comparison.
            </p>
            <p>Key observations from the analysis are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contract Playbook excels in overall functionality but falls short in terms of UX execution.</li>
              <li>CP lags in terms of basic usability and functionality when compared to competitors.</li>
              <li>Competing solutions outperform CP in terms of UX design, usability, and user interaction.</li>
              <li>Competing solutions demonstrate superior performance and speed while delivering an overall smoother
                user experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>My typical approach to the design process involves commencing with initial rough sketches, wireframes,
              and task flows.
              Initially, I consolidate my ideas I then engage in multiple collaborative whiteboard sessions with
              essential team
              members, including product owners, development leads, and stakeholders.</p>

              <li>Collaborative Whiteboard Sessions</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Finding Inspiration</h5>
            <p>Before finalizing a visual direction, I typically explore my preferred sources for inspiration. Websites
              like Dribbble,
              Pinterest, or Google Images serve as excellent platforms for staying informed about the latest design
              trends and
              gathering fresh concepts for potential visual solutions.</p>
